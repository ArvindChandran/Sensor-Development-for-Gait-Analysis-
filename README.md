## Sensor-Development-for-Gait-Analysis

Gait analysis is a systematic evaluation of human motion, and serves as an important medical diagnostic process which has many end user applications in healthcare, rehabilitation therapy and exercise training. The technology supporting the analysis of human motion has advanced over time. However conventional gait analysis must be performed in a gait laboratory, which is costly and hence inaccessible to most people, and also cannot provide gait measurement in a natural terrain. In recent years, demand for wearable sensor systems for the purpose of gait analysis has taken a huge leap as a cost-effective technology and has also shown promising results.
